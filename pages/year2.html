<h3>Matrix Calculator</h3>
<div class="flex" id="mc">
  <iframe class="proj8" src="https://editor.p5js.org/783170/full/WUfH8yZ0a"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo"> This project was created using p5js. It was created as a final project for Linear Algebra in collaboration with Erin De Witt and Maggie McNeary. It uses input boxes to allow the user to choose a size from one to nine and then input values. Each button along the top performs differnt functions related to matricies. I was responsible for the determinant function, the column space function, and the initial input page. </br>The hardest part about the determinant function was deciding on a method of going about it. I chose to create seprate functions for each size matrix and then called the other ones as nessecary. I would now choose a less bulky way of doing it, but it works especially because we limited our matrix size. The hardest thing about the column space was working it off the row reduction function because I didn't make that function. I had to create a new matrix that stored the original vectors because the rref function reset the values of the variable "matrix". Finally I struggeled creating the inputs because I didn't know anything about the input class. I had to learn about the methods it contained, so I could get the result I wanted. Altogether this project was difficult but I enjoyed working in a team. Though the result isn't perfect, I a pleased with the result.</br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/783170/sketches/WUfH8yZ0a">Interact Here</a></p>

<h3>Ballet Clock</h3>
<div class="flex" id="bc">
  <iframe class="proj7" src="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/full/Yu4MYN0l2"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo"> This project was created using p5js. It tells time through the p5js hour(), minute(), and second() functions which take the time from the computer. The arms tell seconds, and the arm changes concavity at 15 and 45 seconds to more accurately reflect ballet technique. Additionally at 30 and 60 seconds, the arm telling time changes. The legs represent minutes, and the leg telling time switches at 30 and 60 seconds. The star represents the hour hand. </br> The first challenge I had was making the arms and legs rotate properly around a specific point. I solved the rotating issue by using radians. I then translated the origin and rotated each image around a new origin. I made sure to use push() and pop() so each translations wouldn't affcet others. The next challenge I had with this project was making sure the changing arms lined up. I solved this by making each arm show up the whole time, so I didn't have to waith for the correct 15 seconds, then I shifted the arms a few pixels at a time until they matched up. </br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/sketches/Yu4MYN0l2">Interact Here</a></p>

<h3>Chutes and Ladders</h3>
<div class="flex" id="cal">
  <iframe class ="proj5" src="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/full/GMsSbF5WY"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo" id = "calInfo" >This project was created using p5js. It replicates the gane of chutes and ladders. When the screen is clicked, a die is rolled and a player is moved. If a player lands at the top of a chute, they slide to the bottom. If a player lands at the bottom of a ladder, they climb to the top. </br> One problem I had was moving the players alon the chutes and ladders. I did not want the to teleport, so I worked on an easing component in their move method. It took a lot of trial and error.  </br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/sketches/GMsSbF5WY">Interact Here</a></p>

<h3>Stuck in the Mud</h3>
<div class="flex" id="sitm">
  <iframe class="proj" src="https://preview.p5js.org/806185/embed/m2_R26LdV"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo"> This project was created using p5js. It replicates a game of stuck in the mud. It rolls dice, and if a die shows a face of 2 or 5, it turns red and is not re-rolled, following the rules of the game. The score is only increased when there are no 2s or 5s in the roll and then all of the face values are added up. The game continues until there are no remaining dice. </br>A challenge with this project for me was getting the removed dicee to not impact the score. I combatted this by permanately setting their face value to 0.</br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/sketches/m2_R26LdV">Interact Here</a></p>

<h3>Cauldron</h3>
<div class="flex" id="cn">
  <iframe class = "proj2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/full/4VuxLfo01"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo"> This project was created using p5js. It automatically stirrs, and begins to bubble when clicked. Clicking again stops the boil. When the bubbles restart in the cauldron, the color changes. This project is scalable, so by changing the variable cnSize, the whole scene shrinks or grows accordingly. </br>A challenge was getting the colors to change every time the bubbles restarted. I fixed this by making the motion variable private to the function and creating a boolean that indicates wether the color should change. </br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/sketches/4VuxLfo01">Interact Here</a></p>

<h3>Simple Racer</h3>
<div class="flex" id="sr">
  <iframe class="proj6" src="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/full/zk2jcowOP"></iframe>
  <p class="pinfo"> This project was created using p5js. When the screen is clicked, the dots begin to race across the screen. The winning dot changes the color of the screen to the color of the dot. The number of dots can be changed and will automatically space evenly. </br></br><a class="projLink" href="https://editor.p5js.org/806185/sketches/zk2jcowOP">Interact Here</a></p>
